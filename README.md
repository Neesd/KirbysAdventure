KirbysAdventure
===============

The replicated Kirby level and the original level for this project have
been connected back to back, so in order to play the original level, you
must run through the first three sections.

Included mechanics:
- Normal floating jump (floats infinitely)
- Quick hop jump (only works on the ground)
  (using hop jump in the air results in float jump)
- Inhaling enemies to steal powers
- Attacking enemies with powers
- Sliding along the ground after pressing down for a short period of time


Mechanics not included (low priority or lack of time):
- Slide kick
- Option to swallow enemies or spit them out as a star
  (at the moment, you immediately get the ability)
- Exhale while float jumping (to kill enemies)
- Diving attack after falling a certain height 
  (Animation is included, but Kirby is not invincible then)
- Underwater physics in section 3 of the replicated level
  (did not change the animations either)
